# The Rust Event-Bot (name subject to change)

This is a small pet-project to write a small discord event-bot. The general idea is that I was too lazy to learn how [Aleeva](https://www.aleeva.io/) works and I simply needed something to create events and specify some roles and flavors.

Currently everything is in-memory, stored in a hashmap. In the near-future the information should then be stored in some SQLite db or something of sorts.
